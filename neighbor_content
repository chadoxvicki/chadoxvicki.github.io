Get a key card in the refrigerator to open the lock \n Take the key card and go to the basement. It looks like the basement from Act 1, right? Do the same and go through the crack in the wall. This is in the room where you had to go through the open window.

Warily ricochet up and to the side to go into the room through the cleared opening. \n For sure, it's absurdly perplexing, and you'll probably do this on different occasions.
