This is somewhat annoying. If I want to go from the road to the sidewalk, the atomically small level of height difference makes it so I have to jump \n My first thought was to make those types of things' clippings as small ramps, but to save the team from working on everything, a smarter way would to somehow change how the character walks. Maybe have their legs lift up more with each step"
